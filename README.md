# SetBrightness

I have a keyboard which allows for special keybindings and it has a scrollwheel. I have the ability on this keyboard to
be able to turn up or down the volume with the scroll wheel but not the brightness on my laptop. With these two programs
that are generated from this Solution, I can call each program to set the brightness of my laptop screen. I set each up
to be able to take one parameter as the amount you would like to increase or decrease the brightness. If no parameter is
passed, then it is increased or decreased by 10%. I also created a shared library in order to reduce the amount of
repeated code required for each executable to work properly.

Finally, since all these programs do is turn up or turn down your brightness, there is no user interface.
